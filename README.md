## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Javascript
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge had a couple of interesting styles that made me learn interesting set of properties, for example the font of the counter split in two colors, or the background images needing some tweaking to look like I wanted too. The background for the footer needed to be on top of the background for the main section, and I achieved this by setting the latter to fixed. 
All in all, I learned a lot about backgrounds with this challenge, and I learned to use pseudo elements and colors in new interesting ways.
